                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Gaebryll, but people call me by my nickname, Gaeb. 
                    My full name is Gaebryll Joanne U. Calledo. My first name is spelled uniquely because my mother didn't 
                    like how the usual spelling looked too masculine. And so she changed the spelling to make it look more 
                    feminine. My family only consists of my parents and me. Being an only, I am quite shy and introverted. 
                    However, I can get along with others easily especially when I open up.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Cebu, I was born on the 22nd day of May. Ever 
                        since I was young, I always loved to do activities that stimulated my creativity. I loved to make art 
                        with various mediums, sing with the karaoke, as well as playing instruments. I even got into a couple 
                        of sports such as swimming, badminton and volleyball. I also have a distinct love for technology. I 
                        loved tweaking things using the computer and I would always bring a gadget with me so as to keep me 
                        entertained.
